#I will use the DNA sequences of four species and the dna code for the oxytocin hormone to try to find the specific oxytocin coding in the animals DNA
#for some sequence if DNA not found but RNA found must convert RNA to DNA
# make sure the sequences are  uppercase
#calculate the length of the oxytocin sequence
#calculate the length of the dna sequences 
#find if the specific DNA sequence for oxytocin is found in the species dna sequences 
#if found, determine the specific bases where the sequence is found
